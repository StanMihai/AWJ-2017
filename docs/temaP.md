Create an application to be used both by teachers and students for attendance checking.
    
# Requirements:
    
 - You must use either Angular (Not AngularJS) or ReactJS;
 - There are no restrictions for the backend;
 - I recommend using Firebase ([Tutorial Firebase](docs/firebase.md)) for backend.
   
## Module 1 (Mandatory) - 15 points

To complete this module you do not need any kind of backend.
    
**Set up Login Page - 3 points** :
- create a component;
- create HTML specific for this kind of page (inputs, buttons);
- for the login you need to use a username and a password;
- for the login to be succesfull, you must compare the username and password with the values stored in "Users" in the environments.ts file.
    
**Set up Registration Page - 5 points** :
- create a component;
- create HTML specific for this kind of page (inputs, buttons);
- for a new user you need to add: username, password, name, surname, e-mail, id (Grupa + serie, example: 322AA); 
- for the registration to be succesfull, you must add the new user in "Users" in environments.ts file.
    
**Set up Attendance page - 5 points** :
- create a component;
- the page must contain 2 columns, one for active Courses and one for active Laboratories;
- the user can only see the Courses and the Laboratories that are underway at that moment specific for their ID;
- in order for the attendance to be successfully committed, you must add the name of the Course/Laboratory to the property "Attendance" for the current user, located in "Users" in environments.ts file.
     
**Set up User Profile Page - 2 points** : 
- create a component;
- the user must be able to see his personal information and his current attendance.

### Environments

When the application is used for the first time "users" array is empty.

This type of storage is volatile, all data is lost after you reset the app. This is not a problem.

environment.ts : 

```bash
export let environment = {
  production: false,
  users: [
            {
                "username": "test",
                "password": "test",
                "name": "Mihai",
                "surname": "Stan",
                "email": "stan.mihaioctavian@gmail.com",
                "id": "322AA",
                "attendance" : ["112"]
            },
            {
                "username": "test1",
                "password": "test1",
                "name": "Ion",
                "surname": "Vasile",
                "email": "ion.vasile@gmail.com",
                "id": "322AB",
                "attendance" : []
            }  
  ],
  laboratories: [
                    {
                        "name": "AWJ",
                        "dates": [
                                    {
                                        "day": "Monday",
                                        "hour": 1300
                                    },
                                    {
                                        "day": "Friday",
                                        "hour": 1800
                                    }
                        ],
                        "groups": ["322AB", "322AC"],
                        "id": "111"
                    },

                                    {

                        ],
